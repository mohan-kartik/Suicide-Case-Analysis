# Project Objective
The topic of suicide rate analysis was chosen due to its critical importance in understanding a global issue that affects countless individuals and communities. 
Analyzing suicide rates can provide valuable insights into underlying factors, trends, and patterns, helping identify vulnerable populations and potential risk factors. 
It is crucial to raise awareness about the prevalence of suicide, reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, and promote the development of effective support systems and interventions.


# Dataset
This compiled dataset pulled from four other datasets linked by time and place, and was built to find signals correlated to increased suicide rates among different cohorts globally, across the socio-economic spectrum.
Sources: United Nations Development Program, World Bank, Suicide in the Twenty-First Century [dataset], World Health Organization.

It has records from 1985 to mid-2016 and has 27820 observations and 10 features listed below:

Country, Year, Sex, Age Group, Suicide Count, Population, HDI for Year, Gdp_per_Capita, Generation.


# Questions for Analysis:
We will try to find the answers for the following questions during our analysis -

1. Which generation has the highest suicide rate?
2. Which `country` has the most suicides cases? Which country has the least suicides cases?
3. What is the relation between the Human Development Index (HDI) and Number of Suicide cases in the USA?
4. Which Age group tends to Commit Suicide ?
5. How does the GDP Per Capita affect the suicide rate?
6. How has the Suicide Rate changed over the years?


# Conclusion:
* In the 1980s, there was a decline in suicides. This could be due to increased awareness of suicide and mental health issues in the 1980s and better identification of people who are at risk. However, we are witnessing an increase in suicides shortly following that.

* The research shows that middle-aged adults ranging in age from 30 to 60 had the most remarkable suicide rate. While the elderly and teenagers have around half the quantity of middle-aged adults, middle-aged people have roughly twice as much.

* Suicide is one of the significant causes of death in adults in the United States. Suicide rates for men and women are alarmingly different. Males are more likely than females to commit suicide. Furthermore, mental health is a significant predictor of suicide.

* We can also conclude that there seems to be a relation between income and suicide rate. As income increases, suicide rate decreases.
