# Project Objective
The topic of suicide rate analysis was chosen due to its critical importance in understanding a global issue that affects countless individuals and communities. 
Analyzing suicide rates can provide valuable insights into underlying factors, trends, and patterns, helping identify vulnerable populations and potential risk factors. 
It is crucial to raise awareness about the prevalence of suicide, reduce the stigma surrounding mental health, and promote the development of effective support systems and interventions.
